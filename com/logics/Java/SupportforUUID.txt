As we all know that Java support UUID and PostgreSQL support UUID but where in case JDBC does not support UUID type 
so whenever you tried to update the DB with UUID type from java then we need to convert to string and persist in the database
and whenever you want to reterieve it then you need to TYPECAST it while get the value some time it leads to a series problem
that we get runtimeexception for type casting which leads your application to exit or misbehave....

To avaoid i have written Type Handler.

This handler can be used in the below envirment

Java 1.5 +
JDBC native_driver
PostgreSQL 9 +
